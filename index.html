        <h1>10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</h1>
        <p>Jakob Nielsen's 10 principles for design are general rules of thumb
            and despite being old they are still very useful today.</p>
        
        <h2>#1: Visbility of system status</h2>
        <p>Heuristic one pertains to the visibility of system status. This means that the system should be 
            keeping its users informed about what is happening. Giving feedback in a reasonable amount of 
            time helps the user know what he/she should be doing next or if it’s alright to change pages. 
            Google Drive’s example of this heuristic is having a bar in the lower right hand corner that keeps users 
            updated on the status of file uploads.</p>

        <h2>#2: Match between system and the real world</h2>
        <p>This heuristic states that the system should speak in the language of the users’ and communicate 
            using words familiar to users instead of system oriented terms. Users may not understand HTML error 
            messages or pathing errors but explaining to them they have no access to a certain document can clear 
            things up. Google Drive has an error system in which errors are presented in clear language and suggested 
            next steps are offered such as requesting access to the document they lack permissions to.</p>

        <h2>#3: User control and freedom</h2>
        <p>Misclicks happen daily on webpages. When these misclicks do happen, it is nice for users to have an “escape route” 
            or undo button to help them. This may be unwanted dialogue or accidentally deleting files and having the option to 
            backtrack can relive a great deal of stress from users. When deleting files in Google Drive, all deleted files go into 
            a trash bin first and can be restored if needed. Having this feature ensures that if a user accidentally deletes a file, 
            it can easily be retrieved.</p>

        <h2>#4: Consistency and standards</h2>
        <p>Platform conventions help make webpages clear by using similar words or images for actions that are the same. Familiarity 
            helps users better understand how things function and breeds memorability. Similar icons also assist in organization within 
            the page. Google Drive has set icons for documents, presentations, spreadsheets and more. Users are then able to easily pick 
            out which file type they are looking for each time they login.</p>

        <h2>#5: Error prevention</h2>
        <p>Error prevention is a huge part of user interfaces. Allowing users to confirm their choices or providing them feedback are 
            staples of user experience. Well thought out designs work to eliminate these errors altogether. Things such as sending an 
            email without a subject or confirming a file deletion are examples of error prevention. Testing designs with multiple users 
            can help fine tune error prevention and leads to a more well-rounded user interface.</p>

        <h2>#6: Recognition rather than recall</h2>
        <p>Autocompleting or giving options to users when searching is part of heuristic six. Things such as allowing searches to be 
            filtered by file type or autocompleting Google searches are quality changes that fall under recognition rather than recall. 
            This puts much less strain on the user’s memory and can make it easier to activate later. Activation of memory is influenced 
            by practice, recency, and context. Helping the user along during this process leads to a more well put together user interface.</p>

        <h2>#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use</h2>
        <p>Appealing to novice users and well as more advanced ones is a quality of good user interface. Shortcuts and other things that 
            are used to accelerate workflow can allow experienced users to optimize their time. Flexibility allows user interfaces to 
            fit any experience level and gives more options to those who know how to use them while giving helpful tips to those who may not. 
            An example of this may be basic keyboard shortcuts. All copy and pasting may be done through menus however, experienced users can 
            use ctrl+c and ctrl+v to speed up this process.</p>

        <h2>#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design</h2>
        <p>Every inch on a screen is valuable and should only contain information vital to the user. The more that is added to a webpage, 
            the more clutter it feels and the ability to see things that are most important is lost. Minimalist design is something that 
            has kept Google as one of the most popular and accessible search engines to date. Google Drive is organized in a similar way 
            with all recently edited or created documents at the top followed by organized tabs on the sides for easy filtering.</p>

        <h2>#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
        <p>Helping users recognize and recover from errors is part of the experience of the user. A common example of this is entering 
            the wrong username or password into a login screen. The webpage should then assist the user in correcting the error by offering 
            things such as a password reset. 404 errors have also been known to help with recovering from errors as they can give the user 
            information about exactly what happened and offer a solution.</p>

        <h2>#10: Help and documentation</h2>
        <p>While a system may work well, documentation may still be needed. Generally users should not have to get the point of needing this 
            help however, having information about common problems readily available can be useful. Google Drive is a simple to use website 
            however, it contains multiple pages of different problems and how to solve them. This allows users to quickly receive answers to 
            questions or get feedback on a new issue.</p>
